# Turborepo starter

Turborepo Starter is a monorepo template setup featuring two applications: one built with Next.js and the other with React Native. The project also integrates Tailwind CSS for efficient and rapid styling of the applications. Additionally, for the React Native app, NativeWind has been added, providing a similar styling approach to Tailwind but tailored for mobile environments.
